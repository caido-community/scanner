# Development Tools

## Testing

Use `pnpm vitest run [filename]` to run specific test files.

Example:

```bash
pnpm vitest run packages/backend/src/checks/robots-txt/index.spec.ts
```

This command runs the vitest test runner on a specific file, which is useful for:

- Testing individual check implementations
- Debugging test failures
- Validating check behavior before integration

## Other Commands

- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint on the codebase
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
